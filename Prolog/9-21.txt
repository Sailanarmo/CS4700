male('Robert Curthose').
parent('William the Conqueror', 'Robert Curthose'). Robert Curthose is a parent to William the conqueror.

What do variables look like?

x can be anything in our list that is a male.

parent('William the Conqueror', x),parent(x,y). I want the grandchildren of William the Conqueror

write('Hello World'). Writes hello world, and returns true.

Unification is the process of deciding whether something matches.
