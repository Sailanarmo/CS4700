Type and Abstraction

===========================================

Type System
	Type Constructors
	Descriptors
	Sometimes called a type algebra

	T const**const

Encapsulation and Information Hiding
	Does the language support thinking at the right level of abstraction?
	Does the language support thinking at multiple levels of abstraction?
	Consider Float

Type Equivalence
	Types are equivalent if no coercion is needed for compatibility
	Name equivalence - types are the same if they are named the same
	Structure equivalence - types are the same if the structure is the same
		
		struct foo
		{
			int x;
		};

		struct bar
		{
			int y;
		};
