What tools exist for encapsulation and abstraction?
	
	can you declare public/private?
	Do you have objects? Hidden data?

User defined type constructor
	
	pointer constructor
	can you write user defined type constructors?
	Vector is a type constructor

Critical for generic programming style
	
	Duck typing? "If you write code that looks like a duck, sounds like a duck, it is a duck."
	Pattern typing

===============================================================================

Expression
	
	Means of expressing computation
	Combination of values and operators that has a value

Operator Overloading
	
	Can users overload operators? 
	Does the language overload operators?
	How does this affect the language? 

Side Effects
	
	A side effect is any observable change in a global state
	Ex:
		Output paramters: Changes something inside the expression
		Global Variables
		Class Variables
		IO

Referential Transparancy
	
	If an expression has no side effects it can be thought of as a reference to its value.
	Functions are called pure if they have this property
	Four major causes of impurity
		Error
		Non-determinism
		Context
		Destruction

Short-Circuit Evaluation

	If the value of an expression can be can be and is determined without evaluating the whole expression it is called short-circuit evaluation
	Very common with boolean algebra
		0 * X = 0
		1 + X = 1
	Also possible with memoized pure functions
